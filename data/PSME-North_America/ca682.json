To investigate the likely performance of large trees in a rapidly changing climate, we analyzed growth rings of five conifer species against 20th century climate trends from local weather stations. Over the local station period of record, there were no temporal trends in precipitation, but maximum temperatures increased by 0.10 to 0.13C/decade (summer and autumn), and minimum temperatures increased by 0.11 to 0.19C/decade in all seasons. All species responded positively to precipitation, but more variation was explained by a significant positive response to minimum winter temperatures. High maximum summer temperature adversely affected growth of two species, and maximum spring temperatures in the year prior to ring formation were negatively associated with growth of one species. The strong coherent response to increasing minimum temperatures bodes well for growth of large trees in Sierra/Cascades region mixed conifer forest under continued climatic warming, but these trees will still be under threat by the increased fire intensity that is a indirect effect of warming.","pubRank":"1"}],"site":[{"NOAASiteId":"55912","siteName":"Plumas County","siteCode":null,"mappable":"Y","locationName":"Continent>North America>United States Of America>California","geo":{"geoType":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"POINT","coordinates":["40","-121"]},"properties":{"southernmostLatitude":"40","northernmostLatitude":"40","westernmostLongitude":"-121","easternmostLongitude":"-121","minElevationMeters":null,"maxElevationMeters":null}},"paleoData":[{"dataTableName":"CA682","NOAADataTableId":"26623","earliestYear":1900,"mostRecentYear":2009,"timeUnit":"AD","earliestYearBP":50,"mostRecentYearBP":-59,"earliestYearCE":1900,"mostRecentYearCE":2009,"coreLengthMeters":null,"dataTableNotes":null,"species":[{"speciesCode":"PSME","scientificName":"Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)
