The near full allocation of water supplies in the Oldman and Bow River subbasins of the South Saskatchewan River Basin has resulted in a moratorium on new surface water licenses. In this region, short instrumental records limit the detection of long-term hydrological variability. To extend the historical record, we collected 14 new moisture-sensitive tree ring chronologies and reconstructed the average October through September flow of the Oldman (1618-2004) and South Saskatchewan (SSR) (1400-2004) rivers. Our SSR proxy record updates a previously published reconstruction. While the 20th century is representative of drought frequency over the long term, droughts are of greater severity and duration in the preinstrumental proxy record. A spectral analysis of the reconstructed flows revealed quasiperiodic cycles at interannual to multidecadal scales.","pubRank":"1"}],"site":[{"NOAASiteId":"54410","siteName":"Stoney Indian Park - Stoney Indian Reserve","siteCode":null,"mappable":"Y","locationName":"Continent>North America>Canada>Alberta","geo":{"geoType":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"POINT","coordinates":["51.13","-114.98"]},"properties":{"southernmostLatitude":"51.13","northernmostLatitude":"51.13","westernmostLongitude":"-114.98","easternmostLongitude":"-114.98","minElevationMeters":"1320","maxElevationMeters":"1320"}},"paleoData":[{"dataTableName":"CANA337","NOAADataTableId":"23456","earliestYear":1597,"mostRecentYear":2003,"timeUnit":"AD","earliestYearBP":353,"mostRecentYearBP":-53,"earliestYearCE":1597,"mostRecentYearCE":2003,"coreLengthMeters":null,"dataTableNotes":null,"species":[{"speciesCode":"PSME","scientificName":"Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)
