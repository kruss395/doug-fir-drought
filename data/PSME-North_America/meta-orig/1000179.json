Reconstructed gauges include the Green River at Green River, Utah; Colorado near Cisco, Utah; San Juan near Bluff, Utah; and Colorado at Lees Ferry, Arizona. The reconstructions explain 72-81% of the variance in the gauge records, and results are robust across several reconstruction approaches. Time series plots as well as results of cross-spectral analysis indicate strong spatial coherence in runoff variations across the subbasins. The Lees Ferry reconstruction suggests a higher long-term mean than previous reconstructions but strongly supports earlier findings that Colorado River allocations were based on one of the wettest periods in the past 5 centuries and that droughts more severe than any 20th to 21st century event occurred in the past.\r\n","pubRank":"1"}],"site":[{"NOAASiteId":"17670","siteName":"Princeton","siteCode":null,"mappable":"Y","locationName":"Continent>North America>United States Of America>Colorado","geo":{"geoType":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"POINT","coordinates":["38.8","-106.23"]},"properties":{"southernmostLatitude":"38.8","northernmostLatitude":"38.8","westernmostLongitude":"-106.23","easternmostLongitude":"-106.23","minElevationMeters":"2956","maxElevationMeters":"2956"}},"paleoData":[{"dataTableName":"NAm-TR_67-co617-1200-1987","NOAADataTableId":"1000196","earliestYear":1200,"mostRecentYear":1987,"timeUnit":"AD","earliestYearBP":750,"mostRecentYearBP":-37,"earliestYearCE":1200,"mostRecentYearCE":1987,"coreLengthMeters":null,"dataTableNotes":"PAGES ID: NAm-TR_67; Correlation with Temperature: negative","species":[{"speciesCode":"PSME","scientificName":"Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)
