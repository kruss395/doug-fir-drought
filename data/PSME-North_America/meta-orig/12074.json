We inferred a multicentury history of fire severity from tree rings in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco) - ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson & C. Lawson) forests in the southern interior of British Columbia, Canada. In 2 ha plots distributed systematically over 1105 ha, we determined the dates of fire scars, indicators of low-severity fire, from 125 trees and inferred dates of even-aged cohorts, potential indicators of high-severity fire, from establishment dates of 1270 trees. Most (76%) of the 41 plots contained fire-scarred trees with a mean plot-composite fire scar interval of 21 years (1700-1900). Most (76%) also contained one or two cohorts. At the plot scale, we inferred that the fire regime at most plots was of mixed severity through time (66%) and at the remaining plots of low (20%), high (10%), or unknown (4%) severity through time. We suggest that across our study area, the fire regime was mixed severity over the past several centuries, with low-severity fires most common and often extensive but small, high-severity disturbances also occasionally occurred. Our results present strong evidence for the importance of mixed-severity fire regimes in which low-severity fires dominate in interior Douglas-fir - ponderosa pine forests in western Canada.","pubRank":"1"}],"site":[{"NOAASiteId":"52379","siteName":"Middle Stein River Valley","siteCode":null,"mappable":"Y","locationName":"Continent>North America>Canada>British Columbia","geo":{"geoType":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"POINT","coordinates":["50.30305","-121.96777"]},"properties":{"southernmostLatitude":"50.30305","northernmostLatitude":"50.30305","westernmostLongitude":"-121.96777","easternmostLongitude":"-121.96777","minElevationMeters":"884","maxElevationMeters":"884"}},"paleoData":[{"dataTableName":"CASTN001","NOAADataTableId":"20434","earliestYear":1511,"mostRecentYear":1999,"timeUnit":"AD","earliestYearBP":439,"mostRecentYearBP":-49,"earliestYearCE":1511,"mostRecentYearCE":1999,"coreLengthMeters":null,"dataTableNotes":null,"species":[{"speciesCode":"PIPO","scientificName":"Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex C.
