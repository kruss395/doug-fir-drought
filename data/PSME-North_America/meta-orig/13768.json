The near full allocation of water supplies in the Oldman and Bow River subbasins of the South Saskatchewan River Basin has resulted in a moratorium on new surface water licenses. In this region, short instrumental records limit the detection of long-term hydrological variability. To extend the historical record, we collected 14 new moisture-sensitive tree ring chronologies and reconstructed the average October through September flow of the Oldman (1618-2004) and South Saskatchewan (SSR) (1400-2004) rivers. Our SSR proxy record updates a previously published reconstruction. While the 20th century is representative of drought frequency over the long term, droughts are of greater severity and duration in the preinstrumental proxy record. A spectral analysis of the reconstructed flows revealed quasiperiodic cycles at interannual to multidecadal scales.","pubRank":"1"}],"site":[{"NOAASiteId":"54409","siteName":"Old Man River - Whaleback Ridge","siteCode":null,"mappable":"Y","locationName":"Continent>North America>Canada>Alberta","geo":{"geoType":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"POINT","coordinates":["49.9","-114.2"]},"properties":{"southernmostLatitude":"49.9","northernmostLatitude":"49.9","westernmostLongitude":"-114.2","easternmostLongitude":"-114.2","minElevationMeters":"1331","maxElevationMeters":"1331"}},"paleoData":[{"dataTableName":"CANA336","NOAADataTableId":"23455","earliestYear":1203,"mostRecentYear":2007,"timeUnit":"AD","earliestYearBP":747,"mostRecentYearBP":-57,"earliestYearCE":1203,"mostRecentYearCE":2007,"coreLengthMeters":null,"dataTableNotes":null,"species":[{"speciesCode":"PSME","scientificName":"Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)
