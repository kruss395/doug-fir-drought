The modern instrumental record of the GSL-level (i.e. elevation) change is strongly modulated by Pacific Ocean coupled ocean/atmospheric oscillations at low frequency, and therefore reflects the decadal-scale wet/dry cycles that characterize the region. A within-basin network of seven tree-ring chronologies was developed to reconstruct the GSL water year (September-August) level, based upon the instrumental record of GSL level from 1876 to 2005. The result was a 576-year reconstruction of the GSL level that extends from 1429 to 2005; all calibration-verification tests commonly used in dendroclimatology were passed. The reconstruction explains 48% of the variance in the instrumental GSL level and exhibits significant periodicity at sub-decadal scales over the past six centuries. Meanwhile, predominance of multi-decadal periodicity in the early half of the record shifted to quasi-decadal dominance in the latter half, and this is consistent with that of proxy reconstructions of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The GSL-level reconstruction is a crucial component to improving our insight into the possible controls of coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions on precipitation delivery.","pubRank":"1"}],"site":[{"NOAASiteId":"56148","siteName":"Willard Ridge","siteCode":null,"mappable":"Y","locationName":"Continent>North America>United States Of America>Utah","geo":{"geoType":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"POINT","coordinates":["41.3667","-111.95"]},"properties":{"southernmostLatitude":"41.3667","northernmostLatitude":"41.3667","westernmostLongitude":"-111.95","easternmostLongitude":"-111.95","minElevationMeters":"2750","maxElevationMeters":"2750"}},"paleoData":[{"dataTableName":"UT537","NOAADataTableId":"27020","earliestYear":1133,"mostRecentYear":2011,"timeUnit":"AD","earliestYearBP":817,"mostRecentYearBP":-61,"earliestYearCE":1133,"mostRecentYearCE":2011,"coreLengthMeters":null,"dataTableNotes":null,"species":[{"speciesCode":"PSME","scientificName":"Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)
