All types historically contained ponderosa pine, but differ in the historical and modern proportions of shade-tolerant versus intolerant tree species. The Persistent Ponderosa Pine and Recent Douglas-fir types occupied relatively hot-dry environments compared to Recent Grand Fir and Persistent Shade Tolerant sites, which occupied warm-moist and cold-wet environments, respectively.  Twentieth-century selective harvesting halved the density of large trees, with some variation among forest types. In contrast, the density of small trees doubled or tripled early in the 20th century, likely due to land-use change and a relatively cool-wet climate. Contrary to the common perception that dry ponderosa pine forests are the most highly departed from historical conditions, we found a greater departure in the modern composition of small trees in warm-moist environments than in either hot-dry or cold-wet environments. Furthermore, shade tolerants began infilling earlier in cold-wet than in hot-dry environments and also in topographically shaded sites in the Ochoco Mountains. Our new classification could be used to prioritize management that seeks to restore structure and composition or create resilience in mixed-conifer forests of the region.

We reconstructed a multicentury history of the spatial complexity in forest fire regimes (frequency, severity, and extent) in dry mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon.  We sampled four 30-plot grids over 3,222 ha, one in the eastern Cascade Range and three in the Ochoco Mountains.  All four sites are currently dominated by grand fir, Douglas-fir, and ponderosa pine with varying, but minor, amounts of western larch, incense cedar, or western juniper growing fine-grained mosaics.  We sampled 4,065 trees to determine their recruitment dates and/or the dates of surface fires and used these to reconstruct remarkably similar historical fire regimes at all four sites.  These regimes were dominated by frequent and often extensive surface fires, but included occasional patches of severe fire.  Although forest types varied within sites, historical fire regimes did not vary substantially among these types.","pubRank":"1"}],"site":[{"NOAASiteId":"56473","siteName":"McKay Creek","siteCode":null,"mappable":"Y","locationName":"Continent>North America>United States Of America>Oregon","geo":{"geoType":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"POINT","coordinates":["44.4855","-120.6445"]},"properties":{"southernmostLatitude":"44.4855","northernmostLatitude":"44.4855","westernmostLongitude":"-120.6445","easternmostLongitude":"-120.6445","minElevationMeters":"1487","maxElevationMeters":"1487"}},"paleoData":[{"dataTableName":"USKAY001","NOAADataTableId":"28414","earliestYear":1339,"mostRecentYear":2010,"timeUnit":"AD","earliestYearBP":611,"mostRecentYearBP":-60,"earliestYearCE":1339,"mostRecentYearCE":2010,"coreLengthMeters":null,"dataTableNotes":null,"species":[{"speciesCode":"ABGR","scientificName":"Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D.
