FIRE REGIME ON A CULTURAL LANDSCAPE: NAVAJO NATION. Thesis.","type":"publication","identifier":null,"abstract":"Fire has played an important role in the evolutionary environment of global ecosystems and Indigenous peoples have long managed natural resources in these fire-prone environments. Increasing severity of large wildfires in the southwestern U.S. affects both tribal and non-tribal lands in the region, but tribal forests are substantially underrepresented in terms of fire regime studies. We worked with the Navajo Nation Forestry Department to evaluate the historic role of fire on a 50 km 2 landscape bisected by a natural mountain pass in the Lukachukai Mountains. We used fifty 5-ha circular plots in order to collect proxy fire history data on fire-scarred trees, stumps, logs, and snags in a coniferous forest. The fire history data were categorized into three groups: All (all 50 plots), Corridor (25 plots closest to Buffalo Pass drainage), and Outer (remaining 25 plots to the north and south, farther from pass).We assessed spatial and temporal patterns of fire recurrence and fire-climate relationships. The landscape experienced frequent fires from 1644, the earliest fire date with sufficient sample depth, to 1920, when the fire regime was completely interrupted. The mean fire interval (MFI) for fire dates scarring 10% or more of the samples was 6.25 years; there were also 13 large-scale fire events fires identified with the 25% filter with an MFI of 22.6 yrs. Fire regimes varied over the landscape, with an early reduction in fire occurrence after 1829, likely associated with pastoralism, in the outer uplands away from the pass. In contrast, the pass corridor had continuing fire occurrence until the early 20th century. Synthesis. Fires were synchronized by large-scale top-down climatic oscillations (drought and La Niña), but the spatially explicit landscape sampling design allowed us to detect bottom-up factors of topography, livestock grazing, and human movement patterns that interacted in complex ways to influence the fire regime at fine scales. Since the early 20th century, however, fires have been completely excluded. Fuel accumulation in the absence of fire and warming climate present challenges for future management.","pubRank":"1"},{"author":{"name":"Whitehair, L., Fulé, P.Z., Sanchez Meador, A.J., Azpeleta Tarancón, A., Yeon-Su, K."},"pubYear":2018,"title":"Fire regime on a cultural landscape: Navajo Nation","journal":"Ecology and Evolution","volume":"8","edition":null,"issue":null,"pages":"9848-9858","reportNumber":null,"citation":"Whitehair, L., Fulé, P.Z., Sanchez Meador, A.J., Azpeleta Tarancón, A., Yeon-Su, K. 2018.
