Mycorrhizal networks are conduits for the transfer of carbon and water between hosts along source-sink gradients. While ectomycorrhizal networks (EMN) are known to influence seedlings, their effect on adult tree growth remains unknown and may have important implications for forest responses to future climates. \r\n2. We used annual basal area increment of trees and a previously described Rhizopogon vesiculosus and Rhizopogon vinicolor EMN to examine an association between the number of connections between trees through an EMN and the growth of adult interior Douglas-fir. We compared this relationship for the year the networks were mapped, in 2008, with eight years previous and eight years afterward. \r\n3. Greater growth was positively associated with 1) the number of connections to other trees via Rhizopogon vinicolor EMN, and 2) the number of genets of Rhizopogon vesiculosis by which a tree was colonized. \r\nSynthesis. These findings, for the first time, indicate that EMNs may positively influence the growth of adult trees. Our study has important implications when considering the role of EMNs in influencing forest health and mitigating environmental stress. â€ƒ","pubRank":"1"}],"site":[{"NOAASiteId":"58492","siteName":"Lac du Bois","siteCode":null,"mappable":"Y","locationName":"Continent>North America>Canada>British Columbia","geo":{"geoType":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"POINT","coordinates":["50.853","-120.52"]},"properties":{"southernmostLatitude":"50.853","northernmostLatitude":"50.853","westernmostLongitude":"-120.52","easternmostLongitude":"-120.52","minElevationMeters":"1000","maxElevationMeters":"1000"}},"paleoData":[{"dataTableName":"CANA611","NOAADataTableId":"43617","earliestYear":1862,"mostRecentYear":2017,"timeUnit":"AD","earliestYearBP":88,"mostRecentYearBP":-67,"earliestYearCE":1862,"mostRecentYearCE":2017,"coreLengthMeters":null,"dataTableNotes":"Tree IDs correspond to IDs in doi:10.5061/dryad.dncjsxkx7","species":[{"speciesCode":"PSME","scientificName":"Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)
