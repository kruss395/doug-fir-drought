Tree densities and fire-/non-fire-initiated groups \nwere highly mixed over the landscape, so distinct fire-created stands could\nnot be delineated from satellite imagery or the oldest available aerial\nphotos. Surface fires were common from 1700 to 1879 in the 4,400 ha site, \nespecially on S and W aspects. Fire dates frequently coincided with fire dates\nmeasured at study sites at lower elevation, suggesting that pre-1880 fire\nsizes may have been very large. Large fires, those scarring 25% or more of the sample trees, were relatively infrequent, averaging 31 years between\nburns. Four of the five major regional fire years occurred in the 1700s,\nfollowed by a 94-year gap until 1879.  Fires typically occurred in significantly \ndry years (Palmer Drought Stress Index), with severe drought in major\nregional fire years. Currently the forest is predominantly spruce-fir, mixed\nconifer, and aspen. In contrast, dendroecological reconstruction of past forest \nstructure showed that the forest in 1880 was very open, corresponding\nclosely with historical (1910) accounts of severe fires leaving partially\ndenuded landscapes. Age structure and species composition were used to classify sampling points into fire-initiated and non-fire-initiated groups. Tree\ngroups on nearly 60% of the plots were fire-initiated; the oldest such groups\nappeared to have originated after severe fires in 1782 or 1785. In 1880, all \nfire-initiated groups were less than 100 years old and nearly 25% of the\ngroups were less than 20 years old. Non-fire-initiated groups were significantly older (oldest 262 years in 1880), dominated by ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, or white fir, and occurred preferentially on S and W slopes. The mixed-severity fire regime, transitioning from lower-elevation surface fires to mixed surface and stand-replacing fire at higher elevations, appeared not to have been stable over the temporal and spatial scales of this study.  Information about historical fire regime and forest structure is valuable for managers but the information is probably less specific and stable for high-elevation forests than for low-elevation ponderosa pine forests.\n","pubRank":"1"}],"site":[{"NOAASiteId":"31446","siteName":"Little Park","siteCode":null,"mappable":"Y","locationName":"Continent>North America>United States Of America>Arizona","geo":{"geoType":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"POINT","coordinates":["36.33139","-112.125336"]},"properties":{"southernmostLatitude":"36.33139","northernmostLatitude":"36.33139","westernmostLongitude":"-112.125336","easternmostLongitude":"-112.125336","minElevationMeters":"2600","maxElevationMeters":"2600"}},"paleoData":[{"dataTableName":"USLPK001","NOAADataTableId":"18657","earliestYear":1500,"mostRecentYear":2000,"timeUnit":"AD","earliestYearBP":450,"mostRecentYearBP":-50,"earliestYearCE":1500,"mostRecentYearCE":2000,"coreLengthMeters":null,"dataTableNotes":"Sample Storage Location: Northern Arizona University (contact\r\nPete.Fulenau.edu)","species":[{"speciesCode":"PIPO","scientificName":"Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex C.
